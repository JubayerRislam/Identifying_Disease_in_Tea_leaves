# Identifying_Disease_in_Tea_leaves


# 🍃 Tea Leaf Disease Classifier

**Tea Leaf Disease Classifier** is a deep learning-based application that identifies diseases in tea leaves from images. This project helps farmers, agronomists, and plantation managers detect diseases early, reducing crop loss and improving yield. The model classifies **8 types of leaves**, including 7 disease categories and healthy leaves.
